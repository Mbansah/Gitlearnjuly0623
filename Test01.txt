July 6: I am practicing how to use git

mkdir means create a folder on your computer
cd means make a particular follow your current directory
git status: A code to check the current status of your command environment

After creating a folder and making sure you are on the right path, you need to initialized git by using the " git init" command.

Next, you can use status to view the files in the current folder. After that use "git add filename" to add the test file to the command line interface (CLI).

At this point you are ready to post your file into the remote Github.
